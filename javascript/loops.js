/**
 * *   Loops execute a block of code a number of times
 *^    ------     Instead of writing:   --------
                    text += cars[0] + "<br>";
                    text += cars[1] + "<br>";
                    text += cars[2] + "<br>";
                    text += cars[3] + "<br>";
                    text += cars[4] + "<br>";
                    text += cars[5] + "<br>";
    ** We can use a loop to do this in one line of code:
    *!             for(var i = 0; i < cars.length; i++)
    *!             {
    *!                  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
    *!              }
    *
    * * ===== Types of Loops in JavaScript ------
    * ^        1. For loop --> loop through a fixed amount of items (use when you know how many times you want the loop to run)
    * !      There are two main types of loops in JavaScript:
     * *         a) "for" loops, which iterate a fixed number of times.
     * *         b) "while" loops, which continue until a condition is false.
     * ^      2.
