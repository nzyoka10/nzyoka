    <p>
        Kenya is a country in East Africa known for its diverse wildlife and picturesque landscapes. It was first inhabited by early hominins over 3 million years ago. The modern Kenyan nation emerged after a struggle for independence from the British Empire. Here's a brief overview of Kenya's history:
    </p>

    <h2>Prehistory</h2>
    <p>
        Kenya's earliest known hominin species are thought to have evolved over 6 million years ago. Some of the most well-known sites from this period include Olduvai Gorge and Koobi Fora.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Civilizations</h2>
    <p>
        Kenya has been inhabited by several civilizations throughout history. These include the pastoralist-based communities known as the Kikuyu and the Maasai, who arrived around 1500 and 200 BCE, respectively. The coastal region, which is today the home of the Mijikenda, the Luo, and other ethnic groups, has a history of interaction with foreign traders.

    <h2>Colonialism</h2>
    <p>
        Kenya was colonized by the British Empire in the 19th century. The British initially focused on controlling the coastal regions and their lucrative trade routes. They gradually expanded their influence inland, coming into conflict with various local communities.
    </p>

    <h2>Independence and the Jomo Kenyatta Era</h2>
    <p>
        After World War II, Kenya gained its independence from the British Empire in 1963. The first prime minister of independent Kenya was Jomo Kenyatta, a key figure in the country's struggle for independence. Under Kenyatta's leadership, the government adopted a policy of ethnic harmony and multi-party democracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Political Unrest and Decolonization</h2>
    <p>
        The late 1950s and 1960s saw increased political unrest and demands for the immediate end of British colonial rule. These events culminated in the Mau Mau Uprising, a widespread insurgency against British rule. The conflict was brutal and led to widespread violence and civilian suffering.
    </p>

    <h2>Present Day</h2>
    <p>
        Since gaining independence, Kenya has faced ongoing challenges such as ethnic tensions, corruption, and the fight against terrorism. However, the country has also experienced significant economic growth and a vibrant tourism industry.
